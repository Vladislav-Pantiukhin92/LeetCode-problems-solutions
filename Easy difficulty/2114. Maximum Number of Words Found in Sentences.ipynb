    "\n",
    "Input: sentences = [\"alice and bob love leetcode\", \"i think so too\", \"this is great thanks very much\"]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- The first sentence, \"alice and bob love leetcode\", has 5 words in total.\n",
    "- The second sentence, \"i think so too\", has 4 words in total.\n",
    "- The third sentence, \"this is great thanks very much\", has 6 words in total.\n",
    "Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.\n",
