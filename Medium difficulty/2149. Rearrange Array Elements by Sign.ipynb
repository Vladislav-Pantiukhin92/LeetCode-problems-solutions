    "You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:\n",
    "Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.\n",

    "The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.\n",

    "The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].\n",
