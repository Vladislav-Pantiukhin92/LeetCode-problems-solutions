    "You are given an integer array nums. A number x is lonely when it appears only once, \n",
    "and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array.\n",
    "Return all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]\n",
    "Output: [10,8]\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.\n",
    "- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.\n",
    "- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.\n",
    "Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].\n",
    "Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,3,5,3]\n",
    "Output: [1,5]\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.\n",
    "- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.\n",
    "- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.\n",
    "Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5].\n",
